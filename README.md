## 2. Requirements
   
### 2.1. Requirements for building the program

For building the program the following software need to be installed on your
computer:
* Boost library (ver. 1.52.0)
* g++ (ver. 4.7 or higher)

__Note:__ You will have to change the paths to the boost libraries in the Makefile before building the project.

### 2.2. Requirements for running the software

For running the program the following software need to be installed on your
computer:
* avconv
* Bash or an alternative shell which supports the same commands
* gnuplot (ver. 4.6)
* GNU parallel

## 3. Running the movie generating scripts
   
### 3.1. Rectangular geometry

For generating a movie from a _.csv_ file considering a rectangular geometry use the script _RectangularGeometryViewer.sh_. The information regarding required parameters is displayed when running the script.

### 3.2. Circular geometry

For generating a movie from a _.csv_ file considering a circular geometry use the script _CircularGeometryViewer.sh_. The information regarding required parameters is displayed when running the script.
