Coding style rules:

  - Tab size: 4 (spaces only);
  - Use camel case for the names of classes, fields, methods and enums;
  
  - Order of writing in source files: include, using, definitions, consts;
  
  - Include paths are relative to the include folder and do not contain "." or "..";
  
  - Insert one empty line between visibility modifiers (public, private, protected) and the 
    subsequent field and method's declarations/definitions;
    
  - Template methods where appropriate should be implemented in the header files inside the class;
  
  - The parent namespace is multiscale;
  - Any subproject/module of the main project is a namespace in itself;
  - Write the name of the namespace in lowercase;
  - Indent all the content of a namespace;
  - Additional folders can be created for organising the source files which do not have a direct 
    corresponding namespace.
