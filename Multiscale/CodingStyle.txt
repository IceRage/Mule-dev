Coding style rules:

    - Tab size: 4 (spaces only);
    - Use camel case for the names of classes, fields, methods and enums;
  
    - Order of writing in source files: include, using, definitions, consts;
  
    - Include paths are relative to the include folder and do not contain "." or "..";
  
    - Insert one empty line between visibility modifiers (public, private, protected) and the 
      subsequent field and method's declarations/definitions;
    
    - Template methods where appropriate should be implemented in the header files inside the class;
  
    - The parent namespace is multiscale;
    - Any subproject/module of the main project is a namespace in itself;
    - Write the name of the namespace in lowercase;
    - Indent all the content of a namespace;
    - Additional folders can be created for organising the source files which do not have a direct 
      corresponding namespace.
      
Build system:

    - CMake + CTest + CPack;
    - The name of input files which are provided to the "configure_file" command have an additional 
      ".in" before the extension.
    - Always edit the "configure_file" command input files from which the output files are automatically
      regenerated.
    
Testing framework:

    - Google Test framework.
    
Continuous integration, deployment and release management:

    - Buildbot.
    
Documentation (inline):

    - Doxygen.
