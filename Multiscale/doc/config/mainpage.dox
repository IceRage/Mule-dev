    The "Multiscale" project comprises software modules for the validation of multiscale spatio-temporal computational models, and the visualisation and analysis of their simulation output. One of the most important software module developed during this project is the multiscale multidimensional spatio-temporal meta model checker Mule. The project was developed by Ovidiu PÃ¢rvu while he was a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science of Brunel University London, London, United Kingdom, 2012-2015.
